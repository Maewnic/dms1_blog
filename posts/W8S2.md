Today we learned how to implement audio into an object and how it will project the sound

# Homework
After I finished with classroom then I find a model of an airplane cabin. The problem is that there are no free proper airplane cabin model. The cheapest one I found is this one from [cgtrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/aircraft/commercial-aircraft/airplane-interior-cabin-890946d6-e9de-4586-a137-0fd7ba8f04b2) for $9. I personally find this part of my enviroment to be very important because this will be the part that build up boredom for the player while walking. Once the player reach the destination I want them to feel relief and free. This will be a good metaphor for a long flight (15 hours to NZ in my case) and I think it will be worth creating this part.

Once I got the model, I realized that the texture wasn't applied automaticly.

It took me a while to figure out how to apply textures in the most efficient way possible. The solution is to 'extract materials' and select the folder that have materials stored.

This process was a success, and will be used again in the future.

While testing everything, I found out that duplicating multiple cabins causes significant lag. I tried combinding all meshes into a single mesh but it was not successful.

Another method I tried is to download Blender and lower the polygons.

I lowered it to the lowest poly count that doesn't distort the whole model.

This was successful! And I can finally move on to the fun part!

I hid the airplane and classroom model under the tarrain so it wouldn't get into the view in of the landscape I'm going to make. A teleporter will be added so that the player can travel to the tarrain.

Some detail I added to the airplane part. I added a bunch of COVID-19, signifying the struggle and fear I have to go through while traveling to NZ. I also made the cabin gradually twisted so it slowly creates a sense of unuaualness, similar to the dutch tilt/angle technique.
