# Class Activity
In this class I created a wireframe based on how I can remember Instagram website.

After I created the first wireframe I had a look at the actual website layout and made a second one.

Doing this activity can help me get an understanding of which part of the website stands out the most or the least.

# Homework
I created four different wireframe for my website. The first one and the third one have a simple looking easy to follow design common to most websites. The second and fourth looks more fun and interesting but may be harder to navigate. (The final wireframe will be select after using grids in W11S2) The amount of writings and images include may not be matching entirely but at least it should give me an idea of how it could look like.
