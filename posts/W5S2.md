*To get my website up and running. I mostly follow the teacher's guidance on setting up Visual Studio Code (VSC) and make sure it link to Github and Deno. I applied the code template provide in canvas to my VSC. The teacher prefer to use java script on this and I pretty much followed everything in class for this process.*

**Reflections and updates**

*I looked back at my previous four icons and I decided to change the colors so it match with each other better. However, I still sick with the same analogous color variant in each of them so that each of the icons can have it's own mood to it. The way I made these icons look like it's from the same family dispite having different colors is by using the same color tone. In my case, I use more of a pastel color to make it more calming and dreamy to look at, while also being more attracted to younger users. Having pastel colors allows me to easily use different color variant. Because pastel colors have similar ammount of value and saturation dispite having different hue. To avoid making my icons plain and boring due to low value and saturation of pastel colors. I have to make sure to add a little more saturation on the parts of the icons I want the user to focus on. This makes the icons more pop, interesting, and gives a better idea of depth between the subject and background. To upgrade my icons and make each of them even more interesting and appealing. I use small amount of gradients in some of the elements in the icons to make it more interesting. Overuse of gradient may make my icons harder to focus, so I have to be careful on the amount of gradient I use on these icons.*
