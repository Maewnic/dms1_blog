**Class activity***
![Class Activity Black Squares](blacksquares.png)
*I learned to use a 'square tool' to create a square and use ALT to quickly duplicate the squares. Using spacebar make it easier to navigate around*

*While making the squares I uses elements of design thinking to the task*
*I uses Emphatize to understand that these designs are for the teacher and students to see. Then I have to define to get a strong idea of what I am suppose to design and what rules are there, such as no more than 4 squares and have to only be black. I looked up on Google to get an idea of what each topic should look like or feel like while viewing. After that I then play around with the design, creating 8 prototypes for each topics. I asked my friend to test and asked for feedback to see if what I designed is relatable to the topic given or not. After everything I picked the designs I think are the best out of each topics and show it at the bottom as a final design.*

**Which prompt/s am I appealed the most?**

**- I am very interested in doing 'Future and Dream'**

*Based on ideas generated. I think I am interested in combinding the two prompts. Having a concept like a 'Dream generator' sounds futuristic and fictional.*

*The icons created would be used on a machine UI that connected to the brain device and user can pick what kind of dreams they would like to have by selecting the icon. It could be a fun adventure, chill, magical, etc. This device is available for all ages but would highly target a younger age. People who have a really wild imagination and would like to have a bit more control over their dreams.*
