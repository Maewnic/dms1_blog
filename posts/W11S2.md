# Class Activity
**Layout Analysis**
In this class I used RMIT homepage website and analize it using twelve column grids.
For desktop, I kept all the settings defult. I only switched to 12 columns and change the column, so it's easier to see.

For mobile, it is a little more complicated to analyse. I have to find the right amount of columns, margin, and gutter to make it the cloesest at it can gets. I ended up with 8 columns, 9 margin, and 14 gutter.
