# Class Activity
**Layout Analysis**
In this class I used RMIT homepage website and analize it using twelve column grids.
For desktop, I kept all the settings defult. I only switched to 12 columns and change the column, so it's easier to see.

For mobile, it is a little more complicated to analyse. I have to find the right amount of columns, margin, and gutter to make it the cloesest at it can gets. I ended up with 8 columns, 9 margin, and 14 gutter.

# Homework
**Applying grids**
I tried using grids in all of my wireframe test to see how each one would change. I found that there were no significant change in comparison. However, it does makes the website look a little more orgainse

After that I asked a few of my classmate which layout do they like the most. There were mixed opinion but most finds wireframe 2 the be the most interesting and can be more navigatable compare to wireframe 4. In the end, I decided to merge some of the elements from wireframe 3 and 4 into the wireframe 2. Wireframe 3 have a front cover and a bar up top that could help the user to navigate faster. While wireframe 4 strenght is how it prioritise the visual element of each projects.

Then I started applying text and images. I included my own photographs in the background as I find it to be aesthetically pleasing but I have to blured it so it would not be too distracting. However, it does set the tone well for each assignments. Other than that I find the assignment 2 to look a little boring when setting up in a 3 by 3 row. So I just scatter it around to make it more fun but still have to be sure that it stays in the grid. I find trasitioning between each assignment can look a bit unclear so I added long bars in between each assignments and added a label to it. Not only that it looks cool, it does makes the seperation a little clearer. Finally I added navigation bar up top that can help scrolling or switching between each assignments easier to navigate.
