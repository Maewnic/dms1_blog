Based on what I observe. Some players struggle to find a way to the lake and door. So I made the lake slightly bigger, add a bit more path leading to the lake (but not all the way because I still want to keep the grass field) and add a light beam from the door. One player somehow ignore the beginning of the path completely so I have to make it bigger to make sure player can see it while not being too distracting.

This is the final room to indicade the player that this is the end/destination. The whole journey was from Thailand to New Zealand. I want to have an ending that leave the player to feel like this is the end of the journey about me but there will more to come. I made a blank room so the player can focus on the last thing in this enviroment. It would also communicate a strong final message to the player. It includes a desk setup similar to one in my room in Thailand. On the desk, there are my graduation photo on the left, a photo of my high-school that I inspired to create this enviroment on the right, and RMIT front page website in the middle indicading my upcoming journey and my focus on moving forward.
