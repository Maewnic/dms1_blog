# Class Activity
**Solar System**

![Creating a sphere](SolarSystem1.png)
I starting by creating a sphere in unity.
![Duplicate sphere](SolarSystem2.png)
I then duplicate 9 more.
![Download texture and put in folder](SolarSystem3.png)
I downloaded all the texture I need and put in a texture folder I created
![Create a skybox](SolarSystem4.png)
Then I create a sky box and applied the texture into the material
![Add planets texture, put them in order and rename](SolarSystem5.png)
I dragged and drop planets textures into each sphere. I also name all the planets and put them in order to keep it organise.
![Adjust size to my liking](SolarSystem6.png)
I adjust each size to my liking.
![Seperate the planets](SolarSystem7.png)
Then I seperate the planets around the sun to mimic planets orbiting around the sun.
![Change the sun material to unlit material](SolarSystem8.png)
I want the sun to have a bit of glow so I change the sun's material to 'unlit'. This removes all of the shadings on the sun, making it brighter than the rest of the planets.
![Change Directional light to point](SolarSystem9.png)
I change the directional light from 'Directional' to 'Point' light and put it inside the sun. This will cast the light coming from the sun to other planets around and also create a shadow on the side of the planet that is facing away from the sun. 
![Create Saturn ring](SolarSystem11.png)
I duplicated saturn, make it a little bigger and then change the Y value to be very low. This makes it a flat circle.
![Finish](SolarSystem12.png)
Finished Solar System.

**Homework**
I started by writing a list of changes I can think of while walking on a treadmill. When I have time. I put everything down in Microsoft Whiteboard and then expand more on what each of them are ment to be.
![BrainStorm](Brainstorm.png)
If I have to pick one. It is obvious to pick the biggest change as it had the most impact in my life and I could express more in Unity. If have to pick NZ or uni. I would pick NZ as it is my past experience while uni is something that's still ongoing and more changes will come later on.
