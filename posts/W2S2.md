**Assignment 1 Storyboard**

*Ambient sounds are present the whole video, giving a sense of realism.*
*A quite beeping sound from the pedestrian crossing. Beeping in a slow tempo.*
*Slow music playing.*

![Task1 Storyboard p2](T1_Storyboard_p2.jpg)
*Similar to the page 1.*

*This is the important part. The slow beep that has been present throughout the montarge switched to a faster beep. This time the video will give a sense of rush and busyness.*
*The music is also in a faster paste.*

![Task1 Storyboard p4](T1_Storyboard_p4.jpg)
*Continues from the previous page.*
*A little over midway through this page. The beep return back to normal tempo as the start.*

*The beep and the music stops once there's a ding sound from the lift. Stopping all the tension.*
*After the lift door opens, the music returns. This creates a really strong scene and a dramatic effect.*
