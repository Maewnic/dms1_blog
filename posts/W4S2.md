**Class activity**
![Speed drawing thumbnail sketches in class activity](Pets_Icons_Sketch.png)
*Though I drew a lot of drawing of cats and dogs to represent 'pets' I realised that people would just think of these as a cat or a dog rather than 'pets'. However, Something I drew that may represent 'pets' more would be something like drawing 16. It's a drawing of a dog sleeping on a dog bed which is something mostly domestic dogs have access to. Therefore, the viewer would think of that more as a pet compare to just a head of a dog.*

**I created 9 categories for dreams. Travel, action, love, time travel, super power, nightmare, famous, abstract, and relax**

*I picked the rocket one because in dreams you can travel anywhere and a rocket would extend beyond the place we know.*

*Action just makes the most sense with both melee and gun. Having a sword and a shield also works but I think both gun and sword could reach a wider meaning of action.*

*I like the flow trail of the heart, I think it would be a great consistance style to have a bit of flow in each icons.*

*Hourglass is a fancy way to show off time and still retain the concept of time travelling*

*Same reason as the 'love' sketch. I like the flow of the wand. It could be someting that stay consistance through out my icons.*

*Ghost is pretty much a standard for horror and nightmare, I also think it's the best out of all due to the flow of it and how clean it would turn out in the end.*

*This one I find it hard to show how it's about fame because I already used star for magic. I think trophy and a star might make the most sense? Trophy might communicate more as 'success' but I think it would work if I add a star with it. Sort of like 'fane and success' meaning.*

*This is also another hard one to show. I think graphic shapes are quite simple yet communicate a lot about how this is abstract. However, I don't think any of these sketches can be match well with other icon sketches so there might be changes in the future.*

*The glass have a similar style to the hourglass to keep the consistancey. I also think it adds a bit of fun into this 'relaxing' design too.*

*Finally, for the final touch. I realised that these sketches maybe hard to find it relation to dream, so I think adding a bubble around all of the icons might make more sense. A bubble is in reference to the 'think bubble' that can also be use for imagination and dream.*
