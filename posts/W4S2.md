*Class activity*
![Speed drawing thumbnail sketches in class activity](Pets_Icons_Sketch.png)
*Though I drew a lot of drawing of cats and dogs to represent 'pets' I realised that people would just think of these as a cat or a dog rather than 'pets'. However, Something I drew that may represent 'pets' more would be something like drawing 16. It's a drawing of a dog sleeping on a dog bed which is something mostly domestic dogs have access to. Therefore, the viewer would think of that more as a pet compare to just a head of a dog.*

**I created 9 categories for dreams. Travel, action, love, time travel, super power, nightmare, famous, abstract, and relax**

*I picked the rocket one because in dreams you can travel anywhere and a rocket would extend beyond the place we know*

*Action just makes the most sense with both melee and gun*

*I like the flow trail of the heart, I think it would be a great consistance style to have a bit of flow in each icons*

*Hourglass is a fancy way to show off time. I added a bit of flow line into this too*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketches5.jpg)
*Same reason as the 'love' sketch, I like the flow in it*

*Ghost is pretty much a standard for horror and nightmare, I also think it's the best out of all due to the flow of it*

*This one I find it hard to show how it's about fame. I think trophy and a star might make the most sense?*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketches8.jpg)
*Another hard one to show. I think graphic shapes are quite simple yet communicate a lot about how this is abstract*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketches9.jpg)
*The glass have a similar style to the hourglass to keep the consistancey. I also think it adds a bit of fun into this 'relaxing' design too*

*Finally, for the final touch. I realised that these maybe hard to find it relation to dream, so I think adding a bubble around all of the icons might make more sense*
