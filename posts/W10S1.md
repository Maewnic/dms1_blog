# Class activity
I recorded a conversation with a friend talking about reflections for A1-3.

# Homework
**Assignment 1 - Video Edit**
 • How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of 
your edit?
*After I took multiple video footage, I then look for and listen to endless list of music from Youtube Audio Library. Once I found the one that I like. I then edit the video to match with the music rtythm well. Other than music, I also have a sound effect and edit to match the tempo together with the video.*

 • How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
 *I make sure to use footages of an object or a scene that can be used to represnt a certain feeling and is possible for me to film. I rely on the camera angle, movement, and editing to expand further on those feelngs.*

 • What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how 
did you apply this knowledge to your project?
*Sound is a really powerful thing to create or convy emotions. Each emotions created were depends on the rhythm, pitch, and pacing. I started the video using slower pacing, making overall video feel calm. Although, one of the parts in the video have a fast pacing to create a feelng of rush and contrats emotions.*

 • How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use 
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project? 
*I included J cut and L cut making using sound to build tension until climax, when the pacing is fast and then slowly let go of it.*

 • Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to 
depict in your portrait? 
*My theme in the video gives more of a hopeful feeling, focusing more on the potential future, despite obstacles, and rising.*

• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your 
work?
*Bright, quite vibrant, warm, and showing a simple scene in a complex way.*


**Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**
 • How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose 
the theme that you did? 
*I'm a fan of dreamy look and style which is why I picked dream. After that I brainstormed on what to use my icons for in the concept of 'dream'. I landed on 'dream generator' which can be cool to use an icon with and it makes sense for icons to be used with dreams.*

• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed 
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
*I drew multiple different styles and eventually picked the ones that I find to be the most possible to make a consistance style out of it.*

 • How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? 
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?
*A lot of the time, tiny details from sketches are lost, to simplify the final flat design further. However, some small graphic shapes like stars and water drop shape are being added to make each design seem like they are from the same family.*

 • How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why 
did you choose the palette that you did?
*I used a similar tone of pastel color and analogous to create a sense of unity. However, I used different hue to communicate different emotions in each of the icons.*

 • How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design 
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?
*I mainly focus on finding short and simple sound that either be a simplied sound version of the object in my icons or an imaginary sound that the object would create.*

 • How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of 
concrete visual designs?
*Create a brainstorm and once I got a topic I create multiple sketches. Once I selected the one I like, I create a graphic of it and try different colors.*


**Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**
 • How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that 
process? 
*I personally don't find prototype I created to be very useful since my environment have a simple layout and my top down map sketch works just fine. The most useful thing about my working prototype is that it can help to give a sence of scale. It can remind me to consider more on the sizing of each objects and moutains on tarrain.*

• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment 
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional 
media?
*There have to thoughts and conciderations around the forced perspective. It can be use as an advantage to manipulate the enviroment to look bigger or smaller. However, it can also be annoying while placing an object in 3D space on a 2D screen. It might look normal in one angle but out of place in another due to lack of depth, so there need to be constant movement around the enviroment.*

 • What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and 
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
*In A1 the creator have full control in what camera angle will be shown while in A3 it's the other way around, the player have full control. The similar thing is how both of these cameras have settings that can be changed, like zoom level and camera effects.*

 • How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your 
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?
*In all of the assigments, sounds are all used to enhance emotions futher, expanding from the visual. The different A3 has to A1 is that A3 is in a 3D space and sound can be set at a certain location in the space. It's entirely in player's control to get closer or further from the sound. While in a video form, the sound was fixed to what it is and there are no control or interations to the behaviour of sound from the viewer (accept for their output volume). For A3 and A2, sound in A2 are only for interactions while that is only a portion of A3. A3 can include different froms of sound such as interactions, 3D sound, diegetic and non-diegetic.*

 • How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme 
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?
*I mainly look out for semi-realistic style for my enviroment. It can look realistic yet sstylized in a way, making the overall environment feel more dreamy.*

 • What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have 
discovered otherwise?
*I can notice the unintended areas where other players would walk to, understand how clear my path is, and see if others would understand my concept.*
