# Class Activity
In this class, I play with force perspective in Unity based on an image in class.

I found an image on the internet and tried making my own one.

# Homework

I started my environment by finding a free model of a classroom from sketch fab.

After I got the model. I have to change some of the materials in the models to make it look right.

Then I have to make sure these objects also cast a shadow so the whole room is not lit.

Also have to make sure that the collider is on.

Finally, I lower the metallic and smoothness of some of the materials so it's doesn't have a weird blue shading from the sky.
