**Changing to second variant of the icon**

*After click for sound and making the second variant. Then I have to apply this into codings to make it work. In this class the teacher taught us on how to make the icons change the image for 1 second using this code*

*After I got the first one to work. Then I tried applying it to all of the icons I had created so far.*

*Once everything is all setup and working properly. I can then comfortably work on finish designing all of the icons I still have left to design.*

*When designing the rest of the icons. I have to make sure that I still apply elements that make my icons look like it's from the same family. This includes pastel colors, analogous colour scheme, simple graphic shapes, no outlines, some gradient, slightly tilted to top right, water drop shapes, and finally some little graphic effects.*

*For the final part of this. I ordered all the icons on the webpage in a row of rainbow color scheme. Starting from pink and end at purple to make it easy to identify each colors. Then I look out for free sound effects to use on my icons. I had a look through YT audio library but there was not a lot of options. So I simply search on Google for a free sound effects websit and came a cross a website called Freesound (https://freesound.org/). There were plenty of options of sound to choose and it's easy to use. However, some sounds I used have to be credited. All sound effects are credited at the end of this blog page. Durning the process I did also use Adobe Audition to cut-off and use a bit of fade out to some sounds to make it a little more snappy and smooth at the end.*
