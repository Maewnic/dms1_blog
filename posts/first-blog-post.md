**Class activity storyboard**

![BladeRunner2049 Storyboard 3](Storyboard_P3.jpg)

**Task 1 Storyboard**

![Task1 Storyboard p1](T1_Storyboard_p1.jpg)
*Ambient sounds are present the whole video, giving a sense of realism.*
*A quite beeping sound from the pedestrian crossing. Beeping in a slow tempo.*
*Slow music playing.*

![Task1 Storyboard p2](T1_Storyboard_p2.jpg)
*Similar to the page 1.*

![Task1 Storyboard p3](T1_Storyboard_p3.jpg)
*This is the important part. The slow beep that has been present throughout the montarge switched to a faster beep. This time the video will give a sense of rush and busyness.*
*The music is also in a faster paste.*

![Task1 Storyboard p4](T1_Storyboard_p4.jpg)
*Continues from the previous page.*
*A little over midway through this page. The beep return back to normal tempo as the start.*

![Task1 Storyboard p5](T1_Storyboard_p5.jpg)
*The beep and the music stops once there's a ding sound from the lift. Stopping all the tension.*
*After the lift door opens, the music returns. This creates a really strong scene and a dramatic effect.*

# This is h5
![Class Activity Black Squares](blacksquares.png)
*I learned to use a 'square tool' to create a square and use ALT to quickly duplicate the squares. Using spacebar make it easier to navigate around*

*While making the squares I uses elements of design thinking to the task*
*I uses Emphatize to understand that these designs are for the teacher and students to see. Then I have to define to get a strong idea of what I am suppose to design and what rules are there, such as no more than 4 squares and have to only be black. I looked up on Google to get an idea of what each topic should look like or feel like while viewing. After that I then play around with the design, creating 8 prototypes for each topics. I asked my friend to test and asked for feedback to see if what I designed is relatable to the topic given or not. After everything I picked the designs I think are the best out of each topics and show it at the bottom as a final design.*

**Which prompt/s am I appealed the most?**

**- I am very interested in doing 'Future and Dream'**

![Mindmap expressing ideas related to the prompt](Prompt_Mindmap.png)

*Based on ideas generated. I think I am interested in combinding the two prompts. Having a concept like a 'Dream generator' sounds futuristic and fictional.*

*The icons created would be used on a machine UI that connected to the brain device and user can pick what kind of dreams they would like to have by selecting the icon. It could be a fun adventure, chill, magical, etc. This device is available for all ages but would highly target a younger age. People who have a really wild imagination and would like to have a bit more control over their dreams.*

![Speed drawing thumbnail sketches in class activity](Pets_Icons_Sketch.png)
*Though I drew a lot of drawing of cats and dogs to represent 'pets' I realised that people would just think of these as a cat or a dog rather than 'pets'. However, Something I drew that may represent 'pets' more would be something like drawing 16. It's a drawing of a dog sleeping on a dog bed which is something mostly domestic dogs have access to. Therefore, the viewer would think of that more as a pet compare to just a head of a dog.*

**I created 9 categories for dreams. Travel, action, love, time travel, super power, nightmare, famous, abstract, and relax**
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch.jpg)
*I picked the rocket one because in dreams you can travel anywhere and a rocket would extend beyond the place we know*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch2.jpg)
*Action just makes the most sense with both melee and gun*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch3.jpg)
*I like the flow trail of the heart, I think it would be a great consistance style to have a bit of flow in each icons*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch4.jpg)
*Hourglass is a fancy way to show off time. I added a bit of flow line into this too*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch5.jpg)
*Same reason as the 'love' sketch, I like the flow in it*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch6.jpg)
*Ghost is pretty much a standard for horror and nightmare, I also think it's the best out of all due to the flow of it*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch7.jpg)
*This one I find it hard to show how it's about fame. I think trophy and a star might make the most sense?*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch8.jpg)
*Another hard one to show. I think graphic shapes are quite simple yet communicate a lot about how this is abstract*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch9.jpg)
*The glass have a similar style to the hourglass to keep the consistancey. I also think it adds a bit of fun into this 'relaxing' design too*
![45 sketches hw](45_Icons_Sketch10.jpg)
*Finally, for the final touch. I realised that these maybe hard to find it relation to dream, so I think adding a bubble around all of the icons might make more sense*

... which can be written inline, like this: $\{ x, y, z \} \in \N$

... or block, like this:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 $$
