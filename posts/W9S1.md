I learned how make a teleport from this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/2IDrPmGf7Mg?si=YSNiHMaJb5eE_5cl). It turned out unsuccessful at first because I haven't add a 'player' tag to my character. After I did, everything worked out well!

Now for the world building part. I started by downloading an environment package from this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/Fhx7t0REfMI?si=O3Xjr7yd7B0pNbof). I changed the grass field texture. I renewed the look of moutains and hills to look more natural and surrounded.

I created tree brushes using models from the package I downloaded and painted it around the tarrain. I still leave a room in the middle for grassfield and lake I planned to add later. I also considered using forced perspective by making smaller trees when it further away, so it creates an illusion of the trees being further away than it actually is.
