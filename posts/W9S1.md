I learned how make a teleport from this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/2IDrPmGf7Mg?si=YSNiHMaJb5eE_5cl). It turned out unsuccessful at first because I haven't add a 'player' tag to my character. After I did, everything worked out well!
![W9S1](W9S1_2.png)
Now for the world building part. I started by downloading an environment package from this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/Fhx7t0REfMI?si=O3Xjr7yd7B0pNbof). I changed the grass field texture. I renewed the look of moutains and hills to look more natural and surrounded.
![W9S1](W9S1_3.png)
I created tree brushes using models from the package I downloaded and painted it around the tarrain. I still leave a room in the middle for grassfield and lake I planned to add later. I also considered using forced perspective by making smaller trees when it's further away, so it creates an illusion of the trees being further away than it actually is. I also added fog to make the overall enviroment more realistic and creates a more sense of depth in this environment.

After the trees, I created a grasses brush and a skybox using materials from the same package. I adjusted the size and color to my liking. Then I created a small path on top, this will be set as a landmark later. I added clouds so it can cast shadows on the grass field... it's a nice small touch... also it creates a parallax effect in the sky, making the sky look more dynamic.

This part I created a lake using a model provided from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOo48Vdtwwk&ab_channel=spaderdabomb). I adjusted all the settings to make it fits with my environment and added small details like rocks model from the previous package.

After I'm done with the overall environment. I want to expand the look of it further, while not making it over the explorable limit. One trick I know is to grab an image of moutains and put it behind the tarrain and lower the brightness of the image. This creates an illusion of moutains being far away in the fog and also combind with forced perspective technique that was used earlier.

To avoid copyright or having to go through process of finding and getting a stock image. I tried using AI as a tool to create a moutain scape that I will be using. The AI I used is "Google Gemini". The prompt I used is in the screenshot.

The background have to be cut out so I put this into Adobe Photoshop and used the Magnetic Lasso tool to cut out the background.
![W9S1](W9S1_7.png)
I want the moutains to be wider to make sure it would fill in the tarrain. I used Photoshop AI tool to fill in the gap using the prompt "Fill in the rest"
![W9S1](W9S1_8.png)
I made a second variant just in case the first one doen't look good.
![W9S1](W9S1_9.png)
This time I put the biggest one in the middle and fill in the gap using the same prompt.
![W9S1](W9S1_10.png)
I put the image on a flat plan and set the material to fade.
![W9S1](W9S1_11.png)
This is the look of it. I was surprised how good this look from afar.
![W9S1](W9S1_13.png)
This is how it's actually look like.
![W9S1](W9S1_12.png)
Another angle with the second one. I added a bench as some sort of landmark so player can pause for while and appreciate the view from above.
![W9S1](W9S1_15.png)
I thought the environment would look a little more interesting and colorful by adding color leaves. So I grabbed the leaves texture from the environment package and adjust the color in Photoshop. This is the yellow one
![W9S1](W9S1_16.png)
and this is the orange one.
![W9S1](W9S1_17.png)
This is the look of it.
![W9S1](W9S1_18.png)
This is from another angle. I'd say this is a huge success and does make this environment significantly more aesthetically pleasing.
![W9S1](W9S1_19.png)
I wanted to have different music play at different places. So I made a trigger box that once the player is in it, it will play a certain music. I found this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ZgS2z-LTs&ab_channel=passivestar) to be the most helpful for doing this.
![W9S1](W9S1_20.png)
This is the code.

![W9S1](W9S1_21.png)

This is what I entered in. For that moment I used the piano music from class as a test to see if everything works.

![W9S1](W9S1_22.png)

I found that there's a bit of lag while entering a different trigger box. I figured it might be because the music have to load after the player triggered the script. What I could do to solve this problem is to lower the quality of the music and set it to 'Load in Background'. This makes all the music load when starting the game so that the sound will already be loaded before player hit the trigger.

Finally, I want the player to walk in a different pace. I believe this will have an impact on how player will experience the game at different stage. The player starts walking slowly, making it feel calm or boring. Once the player speed bumps up in the field, it should make them feel more free and fun. I found this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/RbergKXWWQc?si=Q-7fTRYr7QIG3u8f) to help the most while scripting. I attached this speed script with the music trigger box I added earlier, so they both can be triggered at the same time.

I decided to use classcial music for my environment. Classicl music are known to be complex yet builds a strong emotion and sense of nostalgia. I believe that the music I used match well and can build more layers of emotions in my environment.
