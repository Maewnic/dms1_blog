# Homework
**Shortening and formalising artist statement**

*Assignment 1 - Rising*
Rising is a montage representing the journey, the beauty of improving, and what I aim to be in the future. Filmed using a smartphone and edited in Adobe Premiere Pro, the uplifting and inspiring tone of the video is composed of many different footage and techniques. Using low-to-high camera angles, along with uplifting music, reflects the grounded moments like falling leaves to the grandeur of surrounding environments and the height of a building. The visuals and sound progression of this video create a hopeful feeling, reflecting my personality and how I perceive the world to the viewer.

*Assignment 2 - Dreamtides*
Dreamtide is a dream generation machine inspired by the concept of lucid dreams. These icons allow users to quickly identify, select and control their dream experiences, similar to choosing a genre in visual media. Designed in Adobe Illustrator, the consistent curvy round shapes and pastel colour tones create a soft and dreamy aesthetic in all icons. Each icon has a different look and sound representing its genre such as a rocket for exploration dreams with a woosh sound or a ghost for nightmares with a boo sound. Recurring styles of shapes, like stars and water drops, are used throughout all the icons to create harmonious overall icons. This project demonstrates my ability to unify visuals and sound cohesively. 

*Assignment 3 - Meadow Whispers*
Meadow Whispers is a 3D digital environment reflecting my journey transitioning from Thailand to New Zealand. Created in Unity, It combined different models to create an environment with added classical music to enhance the emotional tone and evoke a sense of nostalgia. Starting in a dark classroom in Thailand with slow music to create a feeling of boredom. Then transitioned into a long aeroplane cabin with flowing music to create a sense of progression. Then reached a beautiful free space in New Zealand with upbeat fantasy music to make the player feel relief. This shows my ability to replicate my feelings from the past in the form of a 3D environment and communicate with the player.
