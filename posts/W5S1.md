**Reflections:**

*I tried different variant and color scheme using monochromatic, analogous, complementary/split complementary, and triadic color palettes. Each of them turned out to be aesthetically pleasing. However, each communicate a completely different vibes when comparing. Monochromatic looks basic, simple, yet pleasing to the eyes. Analogous provides a really strong mood and tone for each icons. Complementary and split complementary makes the icons pop and fun. Triadic makes it look magical in a way. Before I started designing. I thought triadic would work best due to how colorful it is and how it could make the icons more dreamy and magical at the same time. But after experimenting with the colors I found that I like the simpleness yet strong mood and tone coming from analogus. I don't think all of my icons would look good if I use the same color scheme/hue throughout all of the icons because each are supposed to communicate different things. Using analogus could make them more relatable in each icons while using different color scheme.*


**Changes I made on the icons**

*(From now on I'll simplify the name of each icons to whatever the subject is for the convenient. Example: 'Exploration Dream' will be called Rocket icon, 'Magical Power Dream' will be called Magic or Wand icon, etc)*

*Comparing the graphic ones I made to the sketches. There were definitly some changes I made to each of the icons. Like for the rocket icon, I removed the moutains it make it cleaner, and added stars for effects. For the wand icon I didn't change much for the graphic one but I notice I like the flow of the 'Water drop shape' I made using the pencil tool in Ai. So I decided to apply a hint of it to the rest of my icons to keep it consistance. Notice how the heart and the hourglass icons I made after the wand icon kept the same water drop shape and little stars for effects throughout.*
