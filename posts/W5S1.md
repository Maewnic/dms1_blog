**Reflections**
*I tried different variant and color scheme using monochromatic, analogous, complementary/split complementary, and triadic color palettes. Each of them turned out to be aesthetically pleasing. However, each communicate a completely different vibes when comparing. Monochromatic looks basic, simple, yet pleasing to the eyes. Analogous provides a really strong mood and tone for the icons. Complementary and split complementary makes the icons pop and fun. Triadic makes it look magical in a way. Before I started designing. I thought triadic would work best due to how colorful it is and how it could make the icons more dreamy and magical at the same time. But after experimenting with the colors I found that I like the simpleness yet strong mood and tone coming from analogus. I don't think all of my icons would look good if I use the same color scheme throughout all of the icons because each are supposed to communicate different things. Using analogus could make them more relatable in each icons while using different color scheme.*
