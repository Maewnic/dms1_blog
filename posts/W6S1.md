**Applying auido to the icon**

*This process I use the sound recording I recorded earlier in class and apply it to the template icon I use last class. The teacher taught everyone class on how to write a script that the audio will play when clicking on one of the icon.*

**Second variant of the icon**

*To prepare for the next class I made a second variant of my icons I created so far*

*I have to make sure that there's enough but also not too much changes to the icons*

*The idea for my second variant is pretty basic. I just imagine what my icons would do if it's 'in action'. For the rocket, I made it zoomed out a bit. I added an aura to the wand, like a magic is being use. I make the heart shines like it's being fulfilled. The hourglass, I just filp it so it look like the idea of time reversing.*
